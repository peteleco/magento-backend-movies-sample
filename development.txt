Expend the first 2 weeks getting into the basics of magento and after this two weeks i was able
to:
At backoffice:
- Create a config screen that user will be able to set API keys for the TMDB API.
- Add a new movie using TMDB api through javascript. * The v4 api makes available a public token.
- List all movies added at admin
- Mass enable and disable of the added movies, i skip edit because all info came from api and the deletion to avoid cascade deletes
.
At front:
 - list all movies from store
 - see movie detail
 - Add movie to favorite list
 - Remove movie from favorite list

- I was not able to finish the top 10 list and at front list favorite movies of the customer, i was try to make a join with magento collection but i was getting some errors.
